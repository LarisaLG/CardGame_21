                 <h2>HOW TO PLAY BLACKJACK</h2>
                 <p>OBJECTIVE: The Blackjack's game objective is to get a hand total scores of closer to 21 than the
                     dealer without going over 21 (busting).</p>
                 <p>CARD VALUES: Kings, queens, and jacks are worth 10 points. Numbered cards retain their face value.
                     Aces are worth either 1 point or 11 points depending on what value advantages the player.</p>
                 <p>HOW TO PLAY: If the dealer does not deal himself an ace as a face-up card, then player is asked if
                     he/she would like to “hit” or “stand”. To hit is to ask for another card, to stand is to pass. If
                     you choose to hit and then receive a card that puts you over the value of 21, you’ve busted. You
                     may continue to hit until you are satisfied with your hand.</p>
                 <p>A starting hand of a 10 valued card and an Ace is called a Blackjack and beats all hands other than
                     another Blackjack. </p>
                 <p>If both the player and dealer have Blackjack, the result is tie.</p>
